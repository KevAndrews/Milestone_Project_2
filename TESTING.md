## Code Validation
- #### HTML was validated using [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/). The validator gives a warning if you do not use h2-h6 in a section tag, the design of the site did not warrent the use of these tags so I have left these warning in the final version - The results can be found [index.html](images/home_page.png), [game.html](images/game_page.png).
- #### CSS was validated using [jigsaw.w3.org](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) I did not have any errors in the validation - The results can be found [here](images/css.png).
- #### Chromes Developer Tool Lighthouse, this tool highlighted that I was missing the Meta description tag and keywords from my site so I have updated the pages to contain this - The desktop audit results can be found [index.html](PDF/desktop_index.pdf), [game.html](PDF/desktop_game.pdf). 
- #### JS was validated using [jshint.com](https://jshint.com/) For the audio JS I had 2 warnings based on the syntax of JS I was using - The results can be found [here](images/audio.png). For the menu JS I had 6 warnings based on the syntax of JS I was using - The results can be found [here](images/menu.png). For the sendemail JS I had 0 warnings - The results can be found [here](images/email.png). For the maingame JS I had 22 warnings based on the syntax of JS I was using - The results can be found [here](images/menu.png).

- #### Manual Testing was completed using Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari. Testing included the testing of all navigation links and the responsiveness of the site across these browsers. 

- #### Audio Testing was completed using Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari. The JS used to play the audio files will not work on IE 9 or below, I know of possible solutions for this but chose to not support IE browsers.
